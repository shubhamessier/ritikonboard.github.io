                <h2>My Work </h2>
                <p>I look forward to work in areas of embedded systems (majorly Hardware design), electronics, video
                    encoding, and teleoperation in AVs.

                </p>

                        <h3 class="Role">Research Intern, June 2024 - present</h3>
                        <p>I am working under the guidance of <a href="https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~arani/"><u>Dr. Arani
                                    Bhattacharya</u></a> on 'Cloud-Assisted Autonomous Driving over Wireless Network'.
                            The main goal was to achieve minimum network latency in real-time video streaming of the
                            vehicle's perception data and to enable Teleoperation over the cloud network.
                            Integrated CARLA with FFmpeg for efficient encoding and streaming of video data over an RTSP
                            stream, optimizing streaming parameters to minimize latency.
                            Added the teleoperation/manual control feature on the cloud server using keyboard strokes to
                            simulate real-time vehicle control while keeping latency in check.
                            Tested the setup with various video resolutions and network conditions, obtaining
                            significant results.
                            We also worked on modifying PYLOT's Erdos pipeline to enable cloud-based object detection
                            using Yolov8, improving accuracy in complex scenarios.
                            This involved using a lighter detection model on both the server (v8x) and the vehicle (v8n
                            in place of faster-rcnn), with smooth auto-switching between models based on scenarios.
                            Future work involves studying the LIDAR data and working on modifying the rest of Pylot
                            pipeline.
                            Working on this at NRL provided me valuable experience in autonomous vehicle technology,
                            networks, video encoding and related works.
                            Presented our poster titled "Cloud-Assisted Autonomous Driving Over Wireless Network" at ACM
                            COMPASS 2024 held in IIITD between July 8-11th.

                        <p>During the summer of '23 I had an opportunity to mentor a batch of 100+ students during the
                            ESRC workshop
                            in my college. I shared all what i learnt during my time in ESRC as a participant in my
                            first year
                            under the guidance of Dr. Alok Singh Gahlot Sir.
                            I worked on Raspberry Pi Pico, made a fast line follower and took it to IIT Bombay's
                            Techfest.
                            I tried to compile my experience in this video (<a
