                        <h3 class="Role">Research Intern, June 2024 - present</h3>
                        <p>I Worked under the guidance of <a
                            href="https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~arani/"><u>Dr. Arani Bhattacharya</u></a>  Sir on improving the teleoperation capabilities in autonomous vehicles over the cloud.
                            Main goal was to achieve minimum network latency in the real time video streaming of the vehicle's camera data over the cloud.
                            Integrated CARLA with FFmpeg for efficient encoding and streaming of the video data over a RTSP stream while minimising network latency by finding out the right streaming parameters.
                            Implemented Teleoperation/Manual Control on the cloud server using the keyboard strokes to simulate real-time control of the vehicle keeping in check the latency.
                            To make sure there is minimum packet/quality loss, I used PSNR and SSIM video quality metrics to make sure the teleoprator receives visually lossless video and very less noise.
                            Tested the setup with multiple video resolutions, varied network conditions and obtained significant results during the research.
                            Used PYLOT and modified the Erdos pipeline to enable cloud based object detection (using YOLO v8x) with the objective to assess the complex scenarios better 
                            in case the local model's accuracy falls below a set confidence threshold and to reduce the overall detection time by implementing 
                            a lighter detection model on the server as well as the vehicle(Pylot) in place of Faster-Rcnn. Used YOLO v8x on the server and v8n on the local machine(vehicle). 
                            Implemented smooth auto switching between the mdetection models based on the scenarios.

                            </p>
                        </p> Properly integrated the perception module in Pylot and now will work on optimising LIDAR data.
                        I had a good time working on this project, staying in campus, meeting students here, exploring the research aspects. I look forward to see where this takes me.

                        <h3 class="Role">Embedded Systems and Robotics Mentor, June 2023 - July 2023</h3>
                        <p>During the summer of '23 I had an opportunity to mentor a batch of 100+ students during the ESRC workshop
                            in my college. I shared all what i learnt during my time in ESRC as a participant in my first year
                            under the guidance of Dr. Alok Singh Gahlot Sir.
                            I worked on Raspberry Pi Pico, made a fast line follower and took it to iit bombay's techfest.
                            I tried to compile my experience here in this video for the coming juniors.
